# FriendFinder

**Before use, install packages *npm install***

This app is created to take in number of user inputs and compare them to the data of others in order to determine which one is the best match.

The app takes in the following input from the user.
1. Their name.
2. A URL link to their photo.
3. Ten questions regarding their personality with the answers between 1 and 5.

The App then compares their grand total based on their answers and compares that with the grand total of 5 different friends. The one with the least difference to the user is determined to be the best match and their name and photo will be brought up in a modal.

*If the user does not complete the required input, this will not function*
